# SnappySnips

#### By Andy Grossberg

## Description
SQL and C# Independent Project for Week 4 - Advanced Databases

## Rules
Hair Salon Continued
Congratulations! You presented your Hair Salon app to the owner of the salon you go to and they would like to hire you to build an app for their salon, Snappy Snips! However, the owner would like the app to have more functionality. They would like the site to have full CRUD functionality for stylists and clients. They would also like to be able to keep track of stylists' specialties. You will need to create a many-to-many relationship between stylists and specialties since each stylist can have many specialties and many stylists can have the same specialty. The owner was very adamant that they would lose a lot of time and money if the site when down after deployment. To prevent this from happening, make sure to add plenty of tests for each new behavior and to run your tests frequently as you build out the UI.

Note: If you are unfinished with the requirements from last week, make sure to meet those requirements first.

#User Stories
**Here are the user stories that your app should already fulfill:**

* As a salon employee, I need to be able to see a list of all our stylists.
* As an employee, I need to be able to select a stylist, see their details, and see a list of all clients that belong to that stylist.
* As an employee, I need to add new stylists to our system when they are hired.
* As an employee, I need to be able to add new clients to a specific stylist. I should not be able to add a client if no stylists have been added.
* And here are the user stories that the salon owner would like you to add:

* As an employee, I need to be able to delete stylists (all and single).
* As an employee, I need to be able to delete clients (all and single). ***************** Need Delete All Clients from Stylist A)
* As an employee, I need to be able to view clients (all and single). ***************** Need to See Client's Specialties
* As an employee, I need to be able to edit JUST the name of a stylist. (You can choose to allow employees to edit additional properties but it is not required.)
* As an employee, I need to be able to edit ALL of the information for a client.

**Specialty-related additions**
* As an employee, I need to be able to add a specialty and view all specialties that have been added. ************************** 1)
* As an employee, I need to be able to add a specialty to a stylist. *********************************** 2)
* As an employee, I need to be able to click on a specialty and see all of the stylists that have that specialty. ****************************** 3)
* As an employee, I need to see the stylist's specialties on the stylist's details page.  ****************************** 4)
* As an employee, I need to be able to add a stylist to a specialty. ****************************** 5) (Does that stylist exist? Should this be a dropdown menu?)

Naming Requirements

Use your first name and last name to name your databases in the following way:

    Production Database: first_last
    Development Database: first_last_test

Use the following names for your directories:

    Main Project Folder: HairSalon
    Test Project Folder: HairSalon.Tests

In your README, include detailed setup instructions with all commands necessary to re-create your databases, columns, and tables.

When you're finished, export the .sql files holding the information from both your hair_salon and hair_salon_test databases (see instructions in the Exporting MySQL Databases in phpMyAdmin lesson). Please commit these files with your project in the top level of your solution folder.
Previous Objectives

For reference, here are the previous weeks' objectives:

    Do MVC routes follow RESTful convention?
    Tests have complete coverage for all behaviors.
    All tests are formatted correctly and pass.
    Classes are encapsulated and getter methods are used to access properties.
    Logic is easy to understand.
    Build files are included in .gitignore file and are not be tracked by Git
    Code and Git documentation follows best practices (descriptive variables names, proper indentation and spacing, separation between front and back-end logic, detailed commit messages in the correct tense, and a well-formatted README).

## Objectives
Here are the objectives that will be used to review your code:

* Is CRUD functionality implemented for BOTH the Client class and Stylist class? That includes: Create, Read (all and singular) Update and Delete (all and singular).
* Can the user create a new instance of the Specialty class and view all instances of the Specialty class?
* Is the user able to view both sides of the many-many relationship between Stylist and Specialty: For a particular instance of a class, are you able to view all of the instances of the other class that are related to it? And vice versa?
* Is the many-to-many relationship set up correctly in the database?
* Are previous objectives met?
* Is the project in a polished, portfolio-quality state?
* Was required functionality in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline?
* Does the project demonstrate all of this week's concepts? If prompted, are you able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology?

# Previous Objectives
And then, make sure to follow all the requirements from last week too.

* Do database tables and columns follow proper naming conventions?
* Did you include the .sql files in the top level of your solution?
* Do you have thorough test coverage with passing tests?
* Did you write the test methods and make them pass before starting on routes for each class?
* Was Razor syntax used on view pages where appropriate?
* Is your logic easy to understand?
* Did you follow naming conventions?
* Does your code have proper indentation and spacing?
* Did you include a README with a description of the program, specs, setup instructions (for production and test db), a copyright, a license, and your name?
* Is the project tracked in Git, and did you regularly make commits with clear messages that finish the phrase "This commit willâ€¦"?

# Further Exploration
If you finish with time to spare, consider adding the following features:

* Add an appointment class to keep track of appointments. Appointments could have a stylist, a client, a start time, an end time, and a cost. Add a check to make sure a stylist cannot be overbooked.
* Add the ability to delete a specialty from a stylist. Add the ability to delete a stylist from a specialty.
* Add a feature for searching for a particular specialty.
* Format the data entered by the user to be uniform (capitalize first letters of names, change phone numbers to fit (999) 111-2222 format, etc.)
* Add a navbar or sidebar and other styling.
* Use SQL to sort lists before displaying them to the user.
* Add a way to keep track of which days stylists are available at the salon.

## Methodology
This project was similar in structure and scope to the To Do List project. So, I followed a similar design pattern where Stylists were like Categories and Clients were like Items and Stylists had a one-to-many relationship with Clients the way that Categories related to Items.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the git repository from 'https://github.com/agro23/HairSalon.git'.
* Go in to HairSalon -> Startup.cs and change the ConnectionString in DBConfiguration to reflect your correct userID, password, and port as needed.
* Go in to HairSalon.Tests -> ModelsTests -> HairSalonModelTest.cs and change the ConnectionString in DBConfiguration to reflect your correct userID, password, and port as needed.
  - (this will probably be "server=localhost;user id=root;password=root;port=8889;database=to_do_test;")
* Download the database OR use MySQL to:
  - CREATE DATABASE andy_grossberg;
  - USE andy_grossberg;
  - CREATE TABLE `clients` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,

  - INSERT INTO `clients` (`id`, `name`, `stylist_id`) VALUES
(9, 'Brenda', 3);
  - CREATE TABLE `skills` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `stylist_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `specialty_id` int(11) NOT NULL

(2, 'Randi'),
(3, 'Candi'),
(4, 'Jami');
  - CREATE TABLE `treatments` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `specialty_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `client_id` int(11) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  ADD UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`);
- ALTER TABLE `skills`
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  ADD UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`);
- ALTER TABLE `specialties`
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  ADD UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`);
- ALTER TABLE `stylists`
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  ADD UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`);
- ALTER TABLE `treatments`
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  ADD UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`);
- ALTER TABLE `clients`
  MODIFY `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=11;
- ALTER TABLE `skills`
  MODIFY `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=39;
- ALTER TABLE `specialties`
  MODIFY `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=4;
- ALTER TABLE `stylists`
  MODIFY `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=5;
- ALTER TABLE `treatments`
  MODIFY `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=15;

* THEN Follow these same instructions to create the test database andy_grossberg_Test
  - Inside HairSalon.Tests, run the command 'dotnet test' from the command line
  - Inside HairSalon, run the command 'dotnet restore' to download the necessary packages.
  - Run the command 'dotnet build' to build to build the app.
  - Run the command 'dotnet run' to run the server on localhost.
  - Use your preferred web browser to navigate to localhost:5000
